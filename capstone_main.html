            <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
            <p><span4>-</span4></p>
          <p><h2>Who are you as a designer?</h2></p>
        <p>I consider myself to be a product and aesthetic designer. Sketching, digital deisgn, and photography have become very strong points for me as an artist. My goal is to work to the point where I can finally start manipulating the way the world looks aound me, even if it's little by little.</p>
        <p><h2>What is the most important thing you want people to take away from viewing your portfolio?</h2></p>
      <p> My portfolio on this page is meant to give people a snapshot of my work and what the biggest aspects of my artistic career are comprised of. From my Design work, I want people to recognize that I have a talent for craft and physical/material design. When it comes to delivering a product, I never short on flushing out all the details to their fullest extent. In addition, my early programming work has been included to show that while I still have much to learn, I can most certainly build a page for whatever the task at hand is. From my Photography page, I have provided just a small portion of the photos that I love to take on my free time. I can also digitally document projects quite well, as represented on my Design Project page. From my Music page, I want to give people just a snippet of the musical activities that have been apart of my life ever since 5th grade. I have spent more time and money in the activity than I would like to admit, but I do feel that it is important to show something so important and present in my life. Music is art through and through, and it takes a lot of work and dedication and hard work to make it where I have. </p>
      <p><h2>What are your three strongest skills?</h2></p>
      <p>As I stated above, I believe my strongest skills are my ability to produce products, provide digital design for whatever the task, and capture events and document as needed. I have great skill in sketching and producing an image/idea for designers to work with, and my building repertoire of design skills and artistic talent will help me in the future and whatever design firm I end up at. My increasing skills in digital design including thoughtful layouts and aesthetically pleasing design has only just begun. With the world around us becoming more and more digital every year, these skills will be vital to companies looking for a well rounded individual. My photography skills, whether it be for fun or for documentation and presentation of materials is something I believe not everyone can just pick up, and lots of practice has provided me with plenty of material to work with and use to my benefit. I also have a strong affiliation for musical art, as it has been a passion of mine for 11 years, and as I stated, while not a material aspect of design, music is an extremely important and vital art to me.</p>
      <p><h2>What are you using for inspiration?</h2></p>
      <p>My biggest source of inspiration is my father, Brady Olason, who's the Senior Director of Experience Design at Walter Dorwin & Tegues' Boeing Branch. He has been a deisgn since he graduated at WWU, and has worked his way nearly to the top by being an outstanding worker and role model. I hope to one day reach the level of success he has in the last 20 years. Other sources of inspiration include design and tech companies such as Apple and Microsoft, who continually put forth excellent design into all of their products while keep maximum function in mind. </p>
